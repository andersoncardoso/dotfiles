This is the London Smoke GNOME-Shell theme. 
It's based on my London Smoke GTK2 theme: http://therealpadster.deviantart.com/art/London-Smoke-195527397
London Smoke is based on ceebeebg's mockup: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?action=content&content=136369
If you're thinking it looks a lot like Atolm, that is because Atolm is also based on the above mockup.
Half-Left's Atolm GNOME-Shell theme was used as a base: http://half-left.deviantart.com/art/GNOME-Shell-Atolm-204534789

If you change the font-scaling factor (in GNOME Tweak Tool), the menus may look messed up. 
To fix them, you can change the padding values in ".popup-menu-item:active" to:

padding-top: 5px; /*LOOK -needed?*/
padding-bottom: 5px;
padding-left: 27px;
padding-right: 27px;

Thanks to Radist Morse for the tip. 

Also, any comments containing "??" in the gnome-shell.css are markers to show me that I don't know what's going on there, or why something isn't working, so if you know, it would be great if you could add the function in, and give me a yell ;)
